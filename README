USAGE

  YTD2 is for downloading videos as flv/mp4-files on your
  computer.
  The web-browser downloads webresources of youtube 
  (e.g. binary data) to a temporary folder before 
  displaying it. YTD2 does the same except You can choose
  where to save the files.
  The author is not responsible for downloading
  videos that youtube refuses to show in your country.
  Everybody is urged to check ownership of videos before
  downloading! 


FILES

  The source code is available via subversion at
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ytd2/.
  The repository contains either the latest released sources or
  changes for the next upcoming release. There are no branches or
  tags for now.
  The jar-files/sources of the http-components can be downloaded at
  http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi


INSTALL

  There is no need to install it. YTD2 consists of just one
  runnable file. Maybe there is an option of Java Web Start in the
  future if javaw is able to use mirror server. 

	
RUNNING

  runytd2.jar should be executable via Java Runtime Environment
  JRE 1.5 and later.

  running ytd2 via command shell:
  java -jar runytd2.jar 

  running ytd2 via file explorer:
  just click on the jar-file  (works if the file has execute file
  permissions (on *ix platform) and JRE is a registered application
  for jar-files)
  
  
  CLI run (without GUI window) 

  If your linux-box runs in runlevel 5 you have to clear the environment
  variable DISPLAY to use CLI-mode.
  
      knoedel@section60:~/workspace$ unset DISPLAY
  
      knoedel@section60:~/workspace$ java -jar runytd2.jar --help
      V20120407_0955 by MrKnödelmann
      Usage: 
      ...
  
  
  
PROXY

  You can set the proxy either before running ytd2 or after start via
  input "proxy http://proxyhost:proxyport" with or without http://
  
  example (on GNU/Linux) before start:
      knoedel@section60:~/workspace$ http_proxy=http://localhost:3128
      knoedel@section60:~/workspace$ java -jar runytd2.jar
      
  example (on M$-Windows) before start:
      c:\> set http_proxy=http://localhost:3128
      c:\> java -jar runytd2.jar
  
  example after start - type in as URL:
      proxy http://localhost:3128

  
  localhost:3128 is just an example (of a local squid-cache proxy)
  

TODO
  
  - GUI option for proxy
  - correct handling of directories for download (esp. on M$-Windows)
  - submit login credentials or load cookies-file
  - save configuration and load upon start
  - port to Android
	
  maybe: Java Web Start, video from other websites (imdb.com, video.web.de, heise.de/ct-tv)

  Any hints, suggestions, features, questions .. are welcome!

  I decided not to provide a single version number but rather
  a releasedate_time. A number does not provide any extra
  information but the date does. (IMHO)
  YTD2 is named after ytd (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ytd/)
  but the author never changed any bug reports nor answered
  forum posts.


THANKS

  My special thanks go to my family, Dean, Anonyous, "Loki" and "Odie" for testing and support! :)
